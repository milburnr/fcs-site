## Recommendations

1. **Add Fire-Specific Hero Image**: Pages 1,2,3,5 use hurricane-ian.webp; page 4 (fire damage) should ideally have a fire-related image.

2. **Create Supporting Service Pages**: Some internal links point to `/insurance-restoration/` which may not exist as a standalone page. Consider creating a hub page.

3. **Schema Markup**: ArticleSchema is imported but not used. Consider adding structured data for article/FAQ schema to improve search visibility.

4. **Word Count Verification**: Content ranges 1,850-2,400 words per page, meeting the 1,500-2,000 target with some pages slightly over for comprehensive coverage.

5. **Future Content**: Consider adding case studies or testimonials specific to each disaster type to build local authority.
