# Florida Condo Assessment & Remediation Market Research
## Content Strategy Report for Florida Construction Specialists

**Generated:** January 27, 2026  
**Prepared by:** FCS Content Research Agent  
**Purpose:** Create high-value content targeting the emerging Florida condo assessment remediation market

---

## Executive Summary

Florida's SB 4-D (2022) and SB 154 (2023) created one of the largest construction remediation opportunities in the state's history. With approximately **900,000 condo units in buildings over 30 years old** now subject to mandatory milestone inspections and structural integrity reserve studies, the demand for qualified remediation contractors is unprecedented.

**Key Market Drivers:**
- Mandatory milestone inspections for buildings 30+ years old (CO before July 1992 deadline was Dec 31, 2024)
- Structural Integrity Reserve Studies (SIRS) required by December 31, 2025
- Full reserve funding requirements beginning January 1, 2026
- Phase 2 inspections requiring remediation must begin within 365 days of report
- Special assessments ranging from **$10,000 to $100,000+ per unit** being levied statewide

**FCS Opportunity:** Position as the go-to Tampa Bay contractor for condo associations needing Phase 2 remediation work, concrete restoration, balcony repairs, and waterproofing after milestone inspections reveal deficiencies.

## Part 1: Market Opportunity Analysis

### 1.1 Legislative Framework

#### SB 4-D (2022) - "The Surfside Law"
Passed in response to the Champlain Towers South collapse in Surfside (June 24, 2021), which killed 98 people. Key requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Milestone Inspections** | Mandatory for all condo/co-op buildings 3+ stories in height |
| **Building Age Trigger** | 30 years from Certificate of Occupancy (25 years in some coastal jurisdictions) |
| **Frequency** | Initial inspection + every 10 years thereafter |
| **Inspector Requirements** | Licensed Florida architect or engineer |
| **Phase 1** | Visual assessment for "substantial structural deterioration" |
| **Phase 2** | Required if Phase 1 finds issues; may include destructive testing |
| **SIRS Requirement** | Structural Integrity Reserve Study for 8+ components |
| **Reserve Funding** | Must fully fund SIRS reserves (no more waivers after 2025) |

#### SB 154 (2023) - "Glitch Bill" Amendments
Refined the original law with practical adjustments:

- **Removed 25-year coastal deadline** (was creating confusion)
- **Extended SIRS deadline** to December 31, 2025 (from 2024)
- **Allowed SIRS coordination** with milestone inspections through December 31, 2026
- **Clarified reserve waiver rules** - majority vote only through end of 2024
- **Added conflict-of-interest disclosures** for professionals bidding on both inspections and repairs

#### HB 913 (2025) - Latest Updates
Most recent refinements:
- Confirmed December 31, 2025 deadline for SIRS completion
- Required online reporting to DBPR
- Clarified remediation timeline flexibility

### 1.2 Compliance Deadlines

| Building Age | Milestone Inspection Deadline | SIRS Deadline |
|--------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| CO before July 1, 1992 | December 31, 2024 ✓ (passed) | December 31, 2025 |
| CO July 1992 - Dec 1994 | December 31, 2025 | December 31, 2025 |
| CO after Jan 1, 1995 | When building reaches 30 years | Within 10 years of creation or with milestone |
| Coordinated SIRS + Milestone | N/A | December 31, 2026 |

### 1.3 Market Size Estimates

**Tampa Bay Region:**
- Hillsborough County: ~2,500+ condo buildings 3+ stories
- Pinellas County: ~3,000+ condo buildings (highest density in Tampa Bay)
- Pasco County: ~500+ qualifying buildings
- Manatee County: ~400+ qualifying buildings

**Estimated Remediation Spending (Tampa Bay Metro):**
- Conservative: $500M - $750M over next 5 years
- Moderate: $1B - $1.5B over next 5 years
- High (if major issues found): $2B+ over next 5 years

### 1.4 SIRS Components Requiring Reserve Funding

Florida law mandates reserves for these 8 structural components:

1. **Roof** - Replacement/major repair
2. **Structural Systems** - Load-bearing walls, floor foundations, primary structural members
3. **Fireproofing & Fire Protection Systems** - Sprinklers, alarms, fire-rated assemblies
4. **Plumbing** - Main lines, risers, common element piping
5. **Electrical Systems** - Main panels, common area wiring
6. **Waterproofing & Exterior Painting** - Building envelope protection
7. **Windows & Exterior Doors** - Common element windows, sliding doors
8. **Other Items Over $25,000** - Any component impacting structural integrity

**Plus:** Any other item the SIRS professional determines could affect structural integrity if neglected.

### 1.5 Common Issues Found in Milestone Inspections

Based on industry reports and engineering assessments, the most common Phase 2 triggers include:

| Issue | Frequency | Typical Remediation Cost |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|

| **Window/Slider Frame Corrosion** | Common | $2,000-5,000/unit |
| **Electrical System Obsolescence** | Moderate | $500,000+ building-wide |

### 1.6 Project Value Ranges

| Project Type | Typical Value Range | FCS Target? |
|--------------|--------------------|-|
| Phase 1 Inspection (engineering) | $5,000-25,000 | No (engineers) |
| Phase 2 Inspection | $15,000-75,000 | No (engineers) |
| SIRS Study | $10,000-50,000 | No (reserve analysts) |

The Florida condo assessment and remediation market represents a generational opportunity for qualified commercial contractors. With ~900,000 condo units in buildings over 30 years old now subject to mandatory inspections and reserve funding, the demand for quality remediation work will only grow.

FCS is well-positioned to capture this market by:
1. Creating authoritative, helpful content for condo board decision-makers
2. Positioning as the Tampa Bay expert in condo remediation
3. Building relationships with engineering firms conducting inspections
4. Demonstrating commercial construction expertise (not residential)
5. Offering full-service remediation from scope development to final sign-off

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Develop and publish the three pillar pages outlined above
2. Update existing balcony/waterproofing content with condo-specific sections
3. Create downloadable resources for condo boards
4. Develop engineering firm partnership outreach strategy
5. Build case study content as projects are completed
