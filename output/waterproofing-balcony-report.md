## Recommendations

### Content Quality
1. **Image Updates:** All pages use the same hero image (/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FCS-Tiles-on-balcony.webp). Consider adding varied imagery for each page.

2. **Case Studies:** Consider adding a Tampa Bay case study section to 1-2 pages with specific project examples.

3. **Video Content:** The complex topics (waterproofing systems, inspection process) would benefit from embedded video explanations.

### SEO Opportunities
1. **Local Keywords:** Add more Tampa Bay neighborhood names (Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Sarasota) for local SEO.

2. **Featured Snippets:** FAQ sections are structured for Google's FAQ rich results. Consider adding "People Also Ask" style questions.

3. **Cost Pages:** The detailed cost tables may rank well for "balcony waterproofing cost Tampa" type queries.

### Technical Debt
1. **Image Alt Text:** Page 3 (skipped) has good alt text; consider auditing other pages.

2. **Mobile Tables:** Cost tables may need responsive design review for mobile devices.
