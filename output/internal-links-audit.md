## Pillar Page Coverage

All key pillar pages are being linked to across the audited pages:

| Pillar Page | Times Linked |
|-------------|--------------|
| `/contact/` | 20 (100%) |
| `/services/commercial/` | 8 |
| `/services/disaster-recovery/` | 6 |
| `/services/historic-restoration/` | 2 |
| `/balcony-reconstruction/` | 2 |
| `/exterior-waterproofing/` (via residential service) | 2 |
| `/services/commercial/medical-construction/` | 2 |
| `/services/residential/` | 3 |

## Recommendations

1. **New pillar pages to consider linking:**
   - `/condo-milestone-inspection-remediation/` - Could be added to balcony/waterproofing pages
   - `/sb-4-d-compliance-tampa-bay-condos/` - Already linked in some waterproofing pages

2. **Link diversity:** Pages show good diversity in internal links, mixing service pages with related content pages.

3. **Contextual linking:** All pages have contextual links within body content, not just footer InternalLinks components.

- Uses the InternalLinks component appropriately
- Contains 4-5 relevant internal links per page
- Links to at least one pillar/service page
- Links to the contact page for conversion

**No remediation needed.** The pages follow good internal linking practices for both SEO and user navigation.
