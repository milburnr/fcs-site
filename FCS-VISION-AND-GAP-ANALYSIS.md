# FCS Vision & Gap Analysis

**Created:** 2026-01-27
**Purpose:** Comprehensive summary of Rich's intent for the FCS site, what exists, and what gaps remain

---

## Executive Summary

Florida Construction Specialists (FCS) should be positioned as a **premium, large-scale general contractor** serving Tampa Bay—NOT a small-time services company. The vision is to create a website that:

1. **Ranks in Google Map Pack** for commercial and residential construction across 8 cities
2. **Attracts $500K-$50M+ projects** (multimillion dollar commercial, $1M+ luxury residential)
3. **Looks like a $100k+ agency built it** (premium design, not template-ish)
4. **Dominates local SEO** through "Intellectual Residency" strategy

**Target Revenue:** High-value leads for projects in the $250K-$50M+ range

## What Exists Today

### Technical Stack ✅
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Netlify deployment
- Schema markup components

### Page Count
- **482 total page.tsx files**
- **56 local service pages** (service × city combinations) - EXCELLENT content ✅
- **~111 blog/article pages** - THIN CONTENT ❌ (being fixed)
- Core service/location pages

### What's Good ✅

1. **Local service pages (56 pages)** have excellent unique content:
   - City-specific information (landmarks, neighborhoods)
   - Local cost tables
   - Proper schema markup
   - 6,000-12,000 chars substantive content each

2. **Schema components** are built and functional

3. **Business information** is documented (CLAUDE.md):
   - License: CBC1262722
   - Bonding: $10M+
   - Phone: (813) 420-7561
   - Address: 822 Bayview Dr, Ruskin, FL 33579

4. **Technical foundation** is solid (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind)

### What's Bad ❌

1. **111 thin content pages** - Same boilerplate text repeated:
   - "Managing commercial construction delays is crucial..."
   - "When hiring a commercial contractor in Tampa..."
   - Each page only ~900 chars of duplicate content
   - **SEO PENALTY RISK** - Google will penalize this

2. **Design looks template-ish** - Not "expensive" enough for $20k positioning:
   - Color blocks + plain text
   - Missing premium visual effects (glassmorphism, animations)
   - Doesn't look like $50K-$100K agency work

3. **Images are problematic** - Client supposedly getting more

4. **Missing premium positioning language:**
   - Still has "Get Free Estimate" (should be "Schedule a Consultation")
   - Missing project value ranges ($500K-$50M+)
   - Not enough "Prime Contractor" emphasis

5. **Geographic imbalance:**
   - Heavy Tampa focus
   - Missing comprehensive coverage for other 7 cities
