# FCS Thin Content Audit & Fix Log

**Started:** 2026-01-27  
**Status:** AUDIT COMPLETE - READY FOR FIXES

## Problem Identified
Blog/article pages have thin content - topic-relevant headers but identical boilerplate paragraph snippets that don't provide substantive information. Content appears to be placeholder text from WordPress migration that never got filled in.

### Example of Thin Content Pattern:
All these pages show the same 3-4 paragraph snippets repeated:
1. "Managing commercial construction delays is crucial for successfully completing a project..."
2. "When hiring a commercial contractor in Tampa, it is important to consider several key factors..."
3. "Florida Construction Specialists, the top commercial contractor in Tampa, is a master in commercial construction..."
4. "Florida Construction Specialists is leading the way in sustainable commercial construction in Tampa..."

This is a **MAJOR SEO PROBLEM** - Google will penalize or de-index duplicate/thin content pages.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Source Code Location Unknown

The FCS website source code is NOT in this repository (`service-site-builder/sites/fcs-final/`). The directories here are mostly empty. The live site is at floridaconstructionspecialists.com but the editable source files must be elsewhere.

**Before fixing content, we need to locate:**
1. The GitHub repo for floridaconstructionspecialists.com
2. Or the CMS (WordPress, Sanity, etc.) where content is managed
3. Or the Netlify deployment source

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Find & Fix Source (Preferred)
1. Locate the actual source repo for FCS
2. Update each thin page with unique, substantive content
3. Each page needs ~1500-2500 words of unique content
4. Maintain existing structure/layout, just replace boilerplate
5. Include local Florida/Tampa Bay context where appropriate

### Option 2: Noindex Thin Pages (Quick Fix)
If time is critical, add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to all thin pages to prevent Google from penalizing the site. Then fix content over time.

### Option 3: Delete & Redirect (Nuclear Option)
Remove thin pages entirely and set up 301 redirects to relevant service pages. Only recommended if the pages have no organic traffic.
