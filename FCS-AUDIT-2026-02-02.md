**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Site:** floridaconstructionspecialists.com  
**Auditor:** Bo (Clawdbot)

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Health: **B+** (Good with room for improvement)

The FCS site has a solid foundation with:
- Well-implemented dual-funnel architecture separating Commercial and Residential
- Comprehensive schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, Article, Breadcrumb)
- 502 content pages providing topical depth
- Clean URL structure and proper redirects

**Top 5 Priority Issues:**
1. 🔴 **Sitemap contains redirected URLs** - diluting crawl budget
2. 🟡 **Content overlap/cannibalization** - multiple pages targeting similar keywords
3. 🟡 **Schema inconsistency** - not all service pages have ServiceSchema
4. 🟡 **Funnel boundary blurring** - some content appears in wrong funnel
5. 🟢 **Minor: Meta descriptions** - some pages may have thin/duplicate descriptions

---

## Dual-Funnel Architecture Analysis

### ✅ What's Working Well

**Homepage Gateway:**
- Clean dual-pathway cards directing visitors to:
  - `/commercial/` → "Risk & ROI Focus" (B2B)
  - `/residential/` → "Vision & Legacy Focus" (Lifetime homes)
- Clear messaging differentiating the two audiences
- Project range qualifiers ($500K-$25M+ commercial vs $1M+ residential)

**Commercial Funnel (`/commercial/`):**
- Strong B2B messaging focusing on risk mitigation, compliance, ROI
- Proper sub-services:
  - `/commercial/medical-construction/`
  - `/commercial/industrial-construction/`
  - `/commercial/historic-restoration/`
  - `/commercial/condo-remediation/`
  - `/commercial/cpm-scheduling/`
- Cross-references to related services (multi-family, disaster recovery)

**Residential Funnel (`/residential/`):**
- "Lifetime Custom Homes" branding
- Emotional, legacy-focused copywriting
- Waterfront expertise highlighted
- Design-build process explanation

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

**1. Overlapping Service Pages**
Some services appear in BOTH funnels without clear differentiation:

| Service | Commercial | Residential | Issue |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Balcony Reconstruction | `/balcony-reconstruction/` | Same page | Serves both but marketed residential-style |
| Historic Restoration | `/commercial/historic-restoration/` | `/historic-restoration/` | Two pages, one should be canonical |
| Disaster Recovery | `/disaster-recovery/` | N/A | Positioned commercial but no funnel prefix |

**2. Location Pages Not Funneled**
Pages like `/balcony-reconstruction-tampa/`, `/exterior-waterproofing-st-petersburg/` don't indicate which funnel they belong to.

**Recommendation:** 
- Add funnel breadcrumbs (Commercial > Service > Location)
- Consider URL structure: `/commercial/balcony-reconstruction/tampa/`

## Schema Markup Analysis

### ✅ Implemented Schema Types

| Schema Type | Global | Service Pages | Content Pages |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| LocalBusinessSchema | ✅ (all pages) | ✅ | ✅ |
| OrganizationSchema | ✅ (all pages) | ✅ | ✅ |
| ServiceSchema | N/A | ✅ (some) | N/A |
| FAQSchema | N/A | ✅ (many) | ✅ (many) |
| ArticleSchema | N/A | N/A | ✅ (some) |
| BreadcrumbSchema | N/A | ✅ (most) | ✅ (most) |

### Schema Quality Assessment

**LocalBusinessSchema:** ✅ Excellent
```json
- Multiple types: ["LocalBusiness", "HomeAndConstructionBusiness", "GeneralContractor"]
- Credentials: License number included
- Area served: Multiple cities listed
- Price range: "$500,000 - $50,000,000+"
- Opening hours: Properly formatted
```

**ServiceSchema:** ⚠️ Inconsistent
- Present on some service pages (e.g., `/insurance-restoration-tampa/`)
- Missing from core pages like `/commercial-construction/`
- Should be on ALL service pages

**FAQSchema:** ✅ Good
- Found on many pages
- Properly formatted
- Helps with rich snippet potential

### 🔴 Missing Schema Opportunities

1. **ReviewSchema / AggregateRating** - Testimonials exist but no schema
2. **ProjectSchema** - Could mark up featured projects
3. **HowToSchema** - Process sections could use this
4. **VideoSchema** - If videos are added

### Recommendations

1. Add `ServiceSchema` to ALL service landing pages:
   - `/commercial-construction/`
   - `/multi-family-construction/`
   - `/disaster-recovery/`
   - `/historic-restoration/`
   - `/luxury-custom-homes/`
   - `/balcony-reconstruction/`
   - `/exterior-waterproofing/`

2. Implement `AggregateRatingSchema` for testimonials

3. Add `OfferCatalog` to services pages listing sub-services

## Technical SEO Findings

### Crawlability & Indexation

**robots.txt:** ✅ Proper
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://floridaconstructionspecialists.com/sitemap.xml
Crawl-delay: 1
```

**Sitemap:** ⚠️ Issues Found
- Contains URLs that should 301 redirect
- Example: `/a-comprehensive-look-at-commercial-construction-stages-in-florida/` 
  - This redirects to `/commercial-construction/` per netlify.toml
  - Should NOT be in sitemap
- Estimated 50-100 URLs in sitemap that are redirected

**Impact:** Wasted crawl budget, confusing signals to Google

**Fix:** Regenerate sitemap excluding all URLs that have 301 redirects

### URL Structure

**✅ Positives:**
- Clean, readable URLs
- Hyphen-separated
- No parameters/session IDs
- Proper trailing slash handling

**⚠️ Concerns:**
- URL length on some pages is excessive:
  - `/answering-financial-questions-florida-construction-specialists-perspective-on-commercial-construction-in-tampa/`
- Some URL slug duplication:
  - `/benefits-of-design-build-construction-for-commercial-project/`
  - `/benifits-of-design-build-construction-for-commercial-projects/` (typo!)

### Redirects

**✅ Comprehensive redirect strategy in netlify.toml:**
- 100+ 301 redirects consolidating duplicate content
- Proper consolidation to hub pages

**⚠️ Issue:** Some redirects may create chains
- Need to verify no 301→301 chains exist

### HTTPS & Security

✅ Full HTTPS  
✅ Valid SSL  
✅ Proper www → non-www canonicalization  

---

## On-Page SEO Analysis

### Title Tags

**Homepage:** ✅ Good
```
"Tampa Commercial Construction | Florida Construction Specialists"
```

**Service Pages:** ✅ Good examples
```
"Large-Scale Commercial Construction | $500K - $25M+ Projects | Florida Construction Specialists"
"Lifetime Custom Homes Tampa | Luxury Home Builder | FCS | Florida Construction Specialists"
```

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
- Some titles may be too long (>60 chars)
- Check for duplicate titles across similar pages

### Meta Descriptions

**Global fallback:**
```
"With decades of experience in construction and insurance restoration, both residential and commercial, you can count on Florida Construction Specialists."
```

**Assessment:** ⚠️ Generic - page-specific descriptions needed

### Content Depth

**Service Pages:** ✅ Excellent
- `/luxury-custom-homes/` = 95,642 bytes (very comprehensive)
- `/commercial-construction/` = 35,969 bytes (good depth)

**Supporting Pages:** ⚠️ Variable
- Some thin content pages exist (identified in THIN-CONTENT-AUDIT.md)
- Many have been consolidated via redirects
